# ADR-0003 — `ITransferContext` carries transfer options

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2026-09-25

## Context

`ITransferContext` (`Curl.Protocol.Abstractions.UnitLibrary/ITransferContext.cs`)
currently carries only `Url`, `Output`, `Upload`, `TimeProvider` and
`CancellationToken`. That is not enough for a protocol handler to implement curl's
`-r`/`--range`, `-C`/`--continue-at`, `-z`/`--time-cond`, `-R`/`--remote-time`, or
`-i`/`-I`/`-D` (header output and body suppression). These options apply to HTTP and
FTP as much as to `file` — a range or a time condition is not specific to one
scheme — so the contract is shared on `ITransferContext` rather than duplicated
per-protocol.

## Decision

`ITransferContext` is extended with:

- `long? ResumeFrom` — the byte offset for `-C`/`--continue-at`.
- `ByteRange? Range` — the parsed form of `-r`/`--range`.
- `bool NoBody` — `-I`/`--head`, suppressing the response body.
- `TimeCondition? TimeCondition` — the parsed form of `-z`/`--time-cond`.
- `Stream? HeaderOutput` — the destination for `-i`/`-D`-style header output.

with supporting `ByteRange` and `TimeCondition` types added to
`Curl.Protocol.Abstractions.UnitLibrary`.

This is the shape another agent is implementing concurrently; this ADR records it
rather than designing an alternative.

## Consequences

Good:

- Range, resume, time-condition and header-output options are expressible for every
  protocol from one contract, instead of five near-duplicate mechanisms.

Costs and caveats:

- Every current and future `IProtocolHandler` now sees these five fields and must
  decide whether each applies to its scheme. curl itself ignores most options for
  most schemes, and "ignored" is a legitimate, expected answer here too — but it
  must be stated per protocol (in that protocol's own documentation or tests), not
  left implicit.

## Alternatives considered

- **Per-protocol option types, one per handler.** Rejected: range, resume and
  time-condition are not HTTP-specific or FTP-specific concepts; duplicating them
  per protocol would drift the moment one implementation gained a fix the others
  did not.
- **A single untyped `IReadOnlyDictionary<string, object>` bag of options on
  `ITransferContext`.** Rejected: it defeats nullable-reference-type checking and
  moves a compile-time error ("this handler forgot to read `Range`") to a runtime
  one.

## Known limitation, recorded but not decided here

`ITransferContext.Url` remains a `System.Uri`, and `System.Uri` cannot represent
every URL curl accepts. Measured against curl 8.21.0 (2026-06-24) on this machine:

- `Uri` throws on `file:///C:%2FWindows/win.ini` (curl exits 0).
- `Uri` throws on `file://user:pass@localhost/x` (curl exits 3).
- `Uri` rewrites `c|` to `c:`, where curl does not.
- `Uri` folds `file:////server/share` into a UNC authority, destroying the only UNC
  form curl accepts.
- `Uri` normalises `..` away, where curl passes it straight to the OS.

This affects HTTP equally — `%2F` in a path, `--path-as-is` — not only `file`. It is
**not** decided by this ADR; it is deferred to a separate decision owned by the
Core and HTTP work (see `Documentation/Planning/Decisions/README.md` for the ADR
process, and the backlog for the tracking item). Sources:
<https://curl.se/docs/manpage.html> (`--path-as-is`) and
<https://curl.se/docs/url-syntax.html>, both checked against curl 8.21.0.
